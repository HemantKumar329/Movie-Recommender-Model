# Movie-Recommender-Model
## Overview
This is a Python-based movie recommender system that uses **content-based filtering** to suggest movies similar to a given input. The system compares movie features (like genres, plot descriptions, or actor data) to recommend content that matches user preferences.

## How it Works
Content-based filtering relies on the attributes of the movies (e.g., genre, cast, keywords) to recommend similar titles. It computes the similarity between movies using techniques such as **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **cosine similarity**.

### Features
- Recommends movies based on their content similarity to the user's input.
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to calculate how alike two movies are based on their plot descriptions.
- Can be extended to include other attributes like genres, directors, or actors.
